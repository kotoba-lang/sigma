(ns sigma.execute
  "Pure Sigma rule evaluator. matches? tests an event map against a compiled
  rule using host-injected field extraction (sigma.ports/IField). No I/O.

  Condition expression supports:
    identifier      — named selection must match
    not expr        — negation
    expr and expr   — conjunction
    expr or expr    — disjunction
    ( expr )        — grouping
    1 of <glob>     — any selection whose name matches the glob pattern
    all of them     — every defined selection must match
    all of <glob>   — every selection matching the glob must match

  Selection matching:
    Every field-criterion in a selection must match (AND over fields).
    A field-criterion with a list of values is OR over those values by default;
    the |all modifier switches it to AND (all values must match).

  Modifiers:
    contains    — field value (as string) contains the criterion string
    startswith  — field value starts with the criterion string
    endswith    — field value ends with the criterion string
    re          — re-find match of criterion as a regex against the field value
    gt          — field value (numeric) is greater than the criterion (numeric)
    lt          — field value (numeric) is less than the criterion (numeric)
    all         — AND over values instead of OR (logic modifier)"
